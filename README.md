## How to Play

1. The user will be presented with four boxes of different colors.
2. Each level (stage) will have a random box that flashes with an animated blink.
3. The player's objective is to memorize the sequence of flash-blink boxes across all levels.
4. To reproduce the sequence, the player must press the boxes in the same order.
5. Each box press will trigger a sound associated with the color of the box.
6. If the player presses a box in the wrong sequence, the game will end.
7. Let's take an example to illustrate the gameplay:

   - **LEVEL 1**
     - Computer: ğŸ”´ [red]
     - Player: ğŸ”´ [red]

   - **LEVEL 2**
